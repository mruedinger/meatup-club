# Testing Guide - Meatup.Club

## Purpose

This document describes the current test setup, the live coverage baseline, the ideal state for the test suite, and the roadmap for getting there.

## Current Stack

- Test runner: Vitest
- UI testing: Testing Library
- DOM environment: `happy-dom`
- Coverage provider: V8
- Coverage command: `npm run test:coverage`
- HTML coverage report: `/Users/jspahr/repo/meatup-club/app/coverage/index.html`

## Test Layout

```text
app/
├── vitest.config.ts
├── test/
│   ├── setup.ts
│   ├── route-exports.smoke.test.ts
│   ├── timezone.test.ts
│   ├── workflow-truth-suite.test.ts

└── app/
    ├── lib/
    │   └── *.test.ts
    └── routes/
        └── *.test.ts
```

Use colocated tests for feature-specific behavior in `app/app/**`, and reserve `app/test/` for cross-cutting guardrails, smoke tests, or multi-route suites.

## Running Tests

Run all commands from `/Users/jspahr/repo/meatup-club/app`.

```bash
npm run test           # watch mode
npm run test:run       # single run
npm run test:coverage  # single run with coverage
npm run test:ui        # Vitest UI
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Filter to a specific file or pattern when iterating:

```bash
npm run test -- email.server.test.ts
```

- `app/routes/api.places.search.tsx`: `79.31%`
- `app/lib/dateUtils.ts`: `79.71%`

Important interpretation notes:

- `test/route-exports.smoke.test.ts` is a structural smoke suite. It protects route registration and export shape, but it is not deep behavioral coverage.
- `test/admin-polls.form-contract.test.tsx` validates close-poll loader/form contracts with inline test components. It is useful as a guardrail, but it is not true route-level end-to-end coverage.
- The current suite is strongest around auth/session behavior, Google OAuth callback handling, login/logout/pending/dashboard shell routes, webhook security, RSVP parsing, notifications, email template shaping, activity logging, poll/date/admin helpers, member dashboard actions, shared poll/comment/restaurant UI, the Places API, the remaining admin setup/analytics/content routes, and the highest-value workflow seams.
- This slice also surfaced a real security issue: `dashboard.admin.setup.tsx` was proxying a POST to `/api/admin/setup-resend` without re-checking admin access in its `action`, so the route now enforces `requireAdmin` before forwarding the request.
- The workflow suite uses a real in-memory SQLite database loaded from `schema.sql` through a D1-style adapter, which keeps multi-route tests honest without requiring an external test database.
- CI now enforces modest global coverage thresholds through `vitest.config.ts` and the root `.github/workflows/test.yml` workflow.
- The suite now exceeds the long-term numeric target of `70%+` statements and `60%+` branches, so the remaining work is mostly about closing important route gaps rather than chasing aggregate percentages.

## Ideal State

The target is not "100% everywhere." The target is a codebase where a real regression in a core workflow is likely to fail a test quickly.

For this repo, the ideal state is:

- Every mutation-heavy route has real loader/action coverage for success, validation, permission denial, and failure branches.
- Every domain helper that owns business rules has direct tests, not just incidental route coverage.
- Every shared interactive component used in core flows has behavior tests for user-visible state changes and callback payloads.
- A small workflow suite exercises the most important cross-layer journeys end to end.
- Smoke suites remain in place, but they are treated as structural checks rather than substantive behavior coverage.
- No important product file remains at `0%` coverage.

If this state is reached, breaking poll creation, voting, event creation, invites, comment replies, or webhook handling should be difficult to do without at least one failing test.

## Long-Term Coverage Goals

Use these as the ideal-state targets:

- Global coverage: `70%+` statements and `60%+` branches.
- Critical route/action and server modules: `85-95%+` statements with meaningful branch coverage.
- Important product files at `0%`: `0`.
- Major workflows covered: each one should have direct route/helper coverage, and the highest-value flows should also have at least one cross-layer workflow test.

These numbers are not the point by themselves. They are a forcing function to make sure the core meetup workflows are actually defended.

## Testing Strategy

Use the smallest test that proves the behavior:

- Pure utility and server helper logic: unit tests next to the module.
- Route loaders and actions: integration-style tests using a real `Request`, mocked Cloudflare context, and mocked DB/provider boundaries.
- React components: render the real component and assert on user-visible behavior, accessibility, and interaction.
- Full workflows: reserve broader integration or end-to-end tests for high-value journeys that span multiple layers.

What to optimize for:

- Behavior over implementation details.
- Reproducible regression tests for every bug fix.
- Focus on security, permissions, data integrity, and external integration failures before cosmetic UI coverage.
- Keep mocks at the system boundary. Prefer real parsing, validation, and branching logic inside the unit under test.

## Test Standards for This Repo

Use these standards for all new work and all future coverage expansion:

- Any behavior change should include a new test or an update to an existing test, unless the change is strictly static copy, styling, or docs.
- Bug fixes should add a regression test that fails on the pre-fix behavior.
- Smoke tests are useful, but they do not replace behavioral tests for route logic, business rules, or user interactions.
- Tests should cover both the happy path and the most important failure branch for the touched code.
- Security-sensitive code must exercise malformed input, unauthorized access, and external failure cases.
- Route tests should assert on returned data, redirects, status codes, permission checks, and side effects.
- Helper tests should cover business-rule branches directly, especially when the helper owns mutation or validation logic.
- Component tests should render the real component under test rather than a simplified inline stand-in when the goal is to validate app behavior.
- Workflow tests should be used selectively for cross-layer journeys that lower-level tests would not protect well on their own.
- The suite should optimize for trustworthiness, not raw test count.

## Multi-PR Roadmap

### PR 5: Workflow Truth Suite

High-value flows:

- Accept invite
- Vote on poll dates and restaurants
- Close poll and create event
- RSVP webhook update reflected in app state
- Comment reply notification

Guidance:

- Prefer a small number of durable workflow tests over broad brittle end-to-end coverage.
- Each workflow should prove something lower-level tests could still miss.

Exit criteria:

- The app’s highest-value cross-layer journeys have dedicated workflow protection

Current status:

- Complete on 2026-03-06.
- Result:
  Added `test/workflow-truth-suite.test.ts` and `test/support/sqlite-d1.ts` to run real cross-layer workflows against an in-memory SQLite copy of the production schema.
  The suite now covers invite acceptance -> active dashboard access, member voting -> poll close -> event creation, email RSVP webhook -> member-visible RSVP state, and comment reply -> email notification.
  `activity.server.ts` moved to `33.33%` statements / `30.76%` branches.
  `dashboard.admin.polls.tsx` moved to `50.86%` statements / `46.56%` branches.
  Global coverage moved to `61.71%` statements / `49.59%` branches / `49.46%` functions.

### PR 6: Suite Hygiene and Governance

Work items:

- Rework or rename `test/admin-polls-e2e.test.tsx` so its name matches what it actually proves
- Keep `test/route-health.test.ts` as a smoke suite, but document and treat it as structural-only coverage
- Refresh this file whenever the baseline changes materially
- Add or tighten CI expectations only after the suite reaches stable, trustworthy coverage

Exit criteria:

- Test names and docs accurately describe what the suite proves
- Coverage numbers no longer overstate confidence
- The test suite is maintainable, not just large

Current status:

- Complete on 2026-03-06.
- Result:
  Renamed `test/admin-polls-e2e.test.tsx` to `test/admin-polls.form-contract.test.tsx` and `test/route-health.test.ts` to `test/route-exports.smoke.test.ts` so their names match what they actually verify.
  Updated the suite descriptions and this guide so smoke coverage and form-contract coverage are explicitly called out as structural guardrails rather than end-to-end behavior tests.
  Added global coverage thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` at `60%` statements, `45%` branches, `45%` functions, and `60%` lines.
  Added a root `.github/workflows/test.yml` workflow so pull requests and pushes to `main` actually run `typecheck`, `test:run`, and threshold-enforced `test:coverage`.

## Verification Checklist

Before merging behavior changes:

```bash
npm run test:run
npm run typecheck
```

Run these as well when the change touches multiple routes, shared infrastructure, or coverage-sensitive areas:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
npm run build
```

## Debugging Tips

- Use `npm run test` for watch mode while iterating.
- Use `npm run test:ui` to inspect failing tests interactively.
- Open `/Users/jspahr/repo/meatup-club/app/coverage/index.html` after a coverage run to inspect uncovered branches before adding tests.
